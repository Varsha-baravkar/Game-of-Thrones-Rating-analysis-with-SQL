# Game of Thrones: Rating Analysis using SQL
As an avid fan of HBO's epic drama, Game of Thrones, I couldn't resist the opportunity to work on my very first SQL project when I stumbled upon a dataset for the show. I mean  it's hard to find someone who doesn't adore this massive show. I remember waking up early morning as per IST, just to watch the finale episodes. This project is a nostalgic journey that reignites memories, allowing me to showcase my affection for both Game of Thrones and SQL.

### Purpose
The purpose of analyzing a Game of Thrones dataset can vary depending on the specific goals and interests of the analyst. Here are a few potential purposes for analyzing such a dataset:
1. Understanding viewer preferences: By examining the ratings and viewership data, we can gain insights into which seasons or episodes were more popular among viewers.
2. Season-by-season analysis: Analyzing the dataset by season can help us understand the overall trajectory of the show and identify any significant changes in ratings, viewership, or critical reception. This analysis can help uncover factors that influenced the show's success or any potential issues that arose over time.
3. Identifying high and low points: By examining the ratings or viewer opinions, we can pinpoint the highest and lowest-rated episodes or seasons. This analysis can help identify the standout moments, whether positively or negatively, and potentially explore the reasons behind them.

### Data Source
This dataset is publically available on Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/game-of-thrones-episodes?select=game_of_thrones_episodes.csv).
There are 2 data files and they are attached to this repository as well.

### Data Cleaning and importing
I only found messed up date fields in csv. The dates were in different formats and some had leading whitespaces. But this was solved during the data import to MS SQL Server.
